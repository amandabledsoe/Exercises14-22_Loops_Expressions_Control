This my solution for Exercises 14-22 for Loops, Expressions, and Control in the 2022 C# .NET After-Hours Boot Camp at Grand Circus.

# Exercises: Loops, Expressions, and Control

## EXERCISE 14

### Description
Prompt the user for a number. Use a for loop to output the squares of all the numbers from 1 to that number.

### Example
```

1 4
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number: 7
1 4 9 16 25 36 49
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
```

## EXERCISE 15

### Description
Prompt the user for a number. Use a for loop to output the cubes of all the numbers from 1 to that number.

### Example
```
Enter a number: 2
1 8
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number: 7
1 8 27 64 125 216 343
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```

## EXERCISE 16

### Description
Use a for loop to output a triangle of asterisks with a height of ten.

### Example
```
*
**
***
****
*****
******

```

## EXERCISE 18

### Description
Prompt the user to enter a number.  Use a for-loop to calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to the number entered.

### Example
```
Enter a number: 100
5050
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number: 20
210
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```


## EXERCISE 19

### Description
Prompt the user to enter two numbers.  Use a for-loop to calculate the sum of all the numbers from the first number entered to the second.

### Example
```
Enter a number: 12
Enter another number: 21
The sum of all the numbers from 12 to 21 is 165.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number: 3
Enter another number: 5
The sum of all the numbers from 3 to 5 is 12.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```


## EXERCISE 20

### Description
Prompt the user to enter a number.  Use a for-loop to calculate the product of the number and the two preceding numbers.

### Example
```
Enter a number: 6
The product of 6, 5, and 4 is 120.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number: 8
>>The product of 8, 7, and 6 is 120.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```

## EXERCISE 21

### Description
Prompt the user to enter a series of words.  Once the user is done entering the words, output a sentence containing all the words.

### Example
```
Enter a word: The
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? y
Enter a word: cow
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? y
Enter a word: jumped
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? y
Enter a word: over
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? y
Enter a word: the
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? y
Enter a word: moon.
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? n
The cow jumped over the moon.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a word: Hello,
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? y
Enter a word: World!
Would you like to enter another word (y/n)? 
Hello, World!
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```

## EXERCISE 22
### Description
Prompt the user to enter two numbers that will determine a range.  Then prompt the user to enter another number and check if it is in the range.

### Example
```
Enter a number: 7
Enter another number: 25
Your range is 7-25.
Enter a number to verify it is in the range: 20
20 is in the range.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number to verify it is in the range: 32
32 is outside the range.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? y
Enter a number to verify it is in the range: 7
7 is in the range.
Would you like to continue (y/n)? n
Goodbye!
```
